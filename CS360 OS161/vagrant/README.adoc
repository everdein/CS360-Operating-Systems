= `Vagrantfile` for ops-class.org

This boots a VirtualBox VM containing a development environment that you can
use to complete the https://www.ops-class.org[`ops-class.org`] programming
assignments.
//
Vagrant is a good option for Mac and Windows users.
//
If you already have Ubuntu installed, you can
//
https://launchpad.net/~ops-class/+archive/ubuntu/os161-toolchain[add our PPA]
//
and install the toolchain natively using `apt-get`.

== Installation

. (On Windows) Download https://git-scm.com/download/[Git for Windows].
//
This includes a `bash` shell which you should use in lieu of the terrible
Windows shell.
//
. (Required) If you already have https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox]
installed, upgrade to the latest version.
//
. (Required) https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/[Install Vagrant]
//
. (Suggested) Install two Vagrant plugins:
//
.. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest`.
//
This ensure that your VirtualBox Guest Additions are up to date.
//
.. `vagrant plugin install vagrant-timezone`.
//
This synchronizes time between your VM guest and host.

Note that these plugins may be required to get certain Windows systems to
work.

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
vagrant up
----

== Configuration

* The default user and hostname is `trinity@zion`.
//
* The OS/161 toolchain is installed from the
https://launchpad.net/~ops-class/+archive/ubuntu/os161-toolchain[ops-class
OS/161 toolchain PPA].
//
* An up-to-date version of Git is also preinstalled.
//
* The default machine configuration is fairly lightweight.
//
You may want to beef it up a bit.
//
Or not.
//
`sys161` is pretty lightweight itself.
//
* You are encouraged virtual machine to your liking--either by editing the
`Vagrantfile` or by modifying the machine directly.
//

== Known Problems and Workarounds for Windows

=== Missing `MSVCR100.dll`
If your `vagrant up` failed with empty error message like:

image::http://i.imgur.com/75IcjsN.png[GitHub mascot]

It's probably because your Windows OS is missing the `MSVCR100.dll` file.

*Solution:*

1. Download `MSVCR100.dll` from http://fix4dll.com/msvcr100_dll based on your OS.

1. Copy downloaded `MSVCR100.dll` to `C:\Windows\System32\` or `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\` based on your System version 32-bit/64-bit.

=== SSH Connection Issues in Windows Command Prompt

*Symptom:* `vagrant ssh` hangs while connecting.

*Solution:* Vagrant cannot connect over ssh using Windows Command Prompt.  Please use Git Bash or Cygwin instead.


=== Windows Virtualization Issues

*Symptom:*  `vagrant up` Hangs While Connecting

*Solution:*

1. Make sure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS.

2. If Hyper-V is enabled, disable it. Vagrant cannot coexist with Hyper-V.

=== `bmake` fails with symbolic link errors

*Symptom:* `ln: failed to create symbolic link ...`

*Solution:* Windows requires users to have special privileges for creating symbolic links.
